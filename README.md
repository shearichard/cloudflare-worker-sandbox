# Cloudflare Workers Test Area
A project to hold tests I am making with Cloudflare workers.

Initially this will based heavily on the [samples provided by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts). These [examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples) are also useful.

## Node Version
The .envrc in the root of this project is setup to force the Node version to lts/erbium using the [technique seen here](https://blog.differentpla.net/blog/2019/01/30/nvm-direnv/).

## my-ts-project
Based on the Cloudflare sample seen here https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-typescript-template .
